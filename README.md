## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a robust mushroom classification model using a variety of machine learning algorithms. The project includes hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search and model interpretability using XAI techniques.
Moreover, the project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to leverage deep learning for binary classification.

Hyperparameter tuning is performed using Grid Search to ensure the optimal configuration of each machine learning model, and ANN. This systematic approach to hyperparameter optimization improves model performance and robustness.
